            <h2 class="cntenthead">JavaScript Basics</h2>
            <p class="cntent">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-orientes scripting languaje. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flixibility for developers to take in a bunch of diferent directions.
                JavaScript lives inside a host evironment (a web browser or Node server), it cant be connected to the objects of these evironments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <ul class="cntents">
                <li><span>Variable Declaration </span> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with the coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identifed with
                    unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.<b>var x</b>
                    <p></p>
                </li>
                <li><span>Variable Assignment</span>Assiggnament operators assign values to JavaScript variables-our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The=assignament operator assign a value to a variable.<b>var
                    x = 10</b>
                    <p></p>
                </li>
                <li><span>Data Types</span>Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean-<b>true</b> or <b>false;</b> null- <b>null</b>aka
                    nothing; Number- <b>42</b> or <b>3.14159;</b> String- <b>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</b> Arrat- <b>[1,"Coding",2,"Dojo"]</b>; and Objet- <b>{first_name:"Jane", last_name: "Doe"}</b>
                    <p></p>
                </li>
                <li><span>Conditionals</span>When you write code, you want to perform different actions for differents decisions-hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code
                    to accomplish this. There are following conditionals statements: <b>if</b> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <b>else if</b> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false;<b>else</b>we
                    execute this block of code;
                    <p></p>
                </li>
                <li><span>Loops</span>There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some numbers of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around
                    the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!
                    <p></p>
                </li>
                <li><span>Function</span>Function are an en encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of as a list of intructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open
                    up the intruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function and
                    over an over and over again</li>
